# Time-Series-Forecasting-LSTM
Time series forecasting using LSTM in Python. 


This document provides an overview of how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks to forecast time series data in Python. The code provided is an example of how to create and train an LSTM network to predict future values of a dataset. This document provides an overview of the code, including the data used, libraries imported, and results obtained. The source code and the monthly_milk_production.csv data file provided can be used to replicate the results. 

The code provided in the RNN.ipynb file is written in Python and uses the Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries. The monthly_milk_production.csv data file contains monthly milk production data from January 1962 to December 1975 in the United States. The LSTM network created in the code is trained to forecast the milk production data for the next 12 months. 

The code first imports the necessary libraries and the data file. It then performs exploratory data analysis on the dataset to explore the data. The data is then preprocessed and the training and test sets are created. The LSTM network is then created and trained using the training set. The trained model is then used to predict the milk production for the next 12 months. The results are then visualized to compare the actual monthly milk production and the predicted milk production. 

By following the steps provided in this document, you can create and train an LSTM network to forecast time series data in Python.
